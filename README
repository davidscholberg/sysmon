GENERAL

sysmon is a terminal app that outputs various system information on a single
line to standard output. The output format can be specified via a format string
argument. Each monitor is represented with a unique character in the format
string. The characters for each monitor are given below:

    c - cpu activity monitor
    m - used memory monitor
    i - io activity monitor
    d - date monitor

All other characters that appear in the format string are printed as is.

This is an example call to sysmon:

    sysmon "c | m | i | d"

The output of this command would look something like this:

    cpu:  2% | mem: 16% | io:  0% | Tue, Apr  2  5:25 PM

This output represents a snapshot of system resource usage at the time of
execution. After displaying one line of output, sysmon will exit, so if you
want to get continuous updates from sysmon, you'll have to a) run it in a loop,
b) "watch" the command (see 'man watch'), or c) use sysmon in a monitor plugin
such as xfce4's genmon plugin.

COMPILING

To compile sysmon for Linux, use the following command in the sysmon directory:

    gcc -Wall -lrt -pthread *.c -o sysmon

HACKING

New monitors can be easily added. Take a look at any of the existing monitors
(cpu_mon.c, mem_mon.c, etc.) to see how they are written, and make sure to
properly add new monitors in sysmon.c. Note that each monitor runs in its own
thread, so you should make sure to only use thread-safe library calls. See 'man
pthreads' for more info.
